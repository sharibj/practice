Write a class with a member function that accepts two parameters, numThreads and maxNumber.
This method should spawn numThread threads.
Each thread should continue printing a thread identifier and a non-sequential, random number between 0 and maxNumber, inclusive, on a new line till all numbers are printed.
The constraint is that no thread should print a number that has already been printed by it or another thread spawned along with it.

e.g.

Calling code:

NumPrinter n = new NumPrinter()
n.print(5,10)

Output:
t1-1
t4-7
t3-6
t5-5
t2-3
t2-2
t4-4
t3-9
t5-0
t4-10
t5-8
